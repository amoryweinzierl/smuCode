# finalProject
In the final project for my algorithms class, I chose to explore strongly connected communities. I utilizied Depth First Search, Kosaraju's Algorithm, and Tarjan's algorithm to explore this concept and then compared the runtimes between the three algorithms. Also present in this folder is the video I submitted discussing each of the algorithms and my findings.
