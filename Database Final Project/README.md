# NOverdose
Semester project for Team 7

I worked with a team of five other students to created a frontend and backend. The project consisted of taking a set of user stories to create an application that would help track the medications of a user. The user would be able to search for medications and prices, side effects, and symptoms that the medication treated would show up. I worked more on the backend portion, such as on API routes and the SQL statements.
