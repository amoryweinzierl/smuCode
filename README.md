This github repo is a demonstration of my computer science skills through a selection of coding assignments I have completed at Southern Methodist University. 

Sprint 1 - a project where I created the DSString data structure in order to analyze the activity of a laser tag game

Sprint 2 - using the DSSVector and DSString data structures I created, I analyzed the sentiment of tweets to determine whether they                  communicated positive or negative messages

Sprint 3 - I implemented and analyzed the different runtimes of different sorting algorithms

Sprint 4 - Using an adjacency list, I tracked connecting flights through different cities (for this project: my solution was unsuccessful. I am including it in the repository to demonstrate that I am familiar with linked lists/adjacency list as well as the other concepts of the prompt)

lib - the data structures I "harcoded" in order to mimic already existing data structures.
